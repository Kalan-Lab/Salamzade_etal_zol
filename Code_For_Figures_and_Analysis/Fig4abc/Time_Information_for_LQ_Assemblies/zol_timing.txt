Determining orthogroups
--------------------
Requested mode was to only compute ortholog groups across gene clusters.
The ortholog-group by gene-cluster matrix can be found at: /workspace/local/rauf/zol/update_manuscript_apps/Enterococcus_Epa/Comparisons/Benchmark_LowQualAssemblies/zol_Results/Determine_Orthogroups/Orthogroups.tsv
