Writing orthogroups to file
---------------------------
OrthoFinder assigned 1838 genes (99.5% of total) to 43 orthogroups. Fifty percent of all genes were in orthogroups with 52 or more genes (G50 was 52) and were contained in the largest 13 orthogroups (O50 was 13). There were 24 orthogroups with all species present and 1 of these consisted entirely of single-copy genes.
